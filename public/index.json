Dockge isn’t just another wrapper around Docker — it genuinely impressed me. It has a beautiful, modern interface, works fast, and most importantly, makes it super easy to start, stop, and monitor services in a stack. Some highlights: Fully self-hosted — I just added it as a service in my existing docker-compose.yml. Supports multiple stacks and lets you switch between them effortlessly. Displays logs, statuses, ports, and even lets you edit files directly from the UI. It’s exactly what I’ve been missing for managing several projects — each with their own setup of Redis, Postgres, Sidekiq, web servers, and more. If you’re managing multiple containers and tired of running docker compose ps, logs, up -d all the time in the terminal — give Dockge a try. It might just become your new favorite DevOps tool.
