# ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Including `nil` in `.where(id: [...])` Can Severely Impact PostgreSQL Performance

When writing queries like:

``` ruby
User.where(id: [1, 2, nil, 3, 4])
```

it‚Äôs easy to accidentally include a `nil` in the array. Although it may seem harmless, this can have **serious performance implications**, especially on large datasets ‚Äî and can even cause **query timeouts**.

---

## üîç What Happens Behind the Scenes?

ActiveRecord transforms the query to something like this:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3, 4) OR id IS NULL;
```

PostgreSQL requires the `OR id IS NULL` part because `NULL` cannot be directly compared using `IN (...)`.

---

## üìâ Performance Impact

This small change completely alters the query plan:

- Instead of a fast `Index Scan`, PostgreSQL may use `BitmapOr` and `Bitmap Heap Scan`
- It must separately evaluate the `id IS NULL` condition
- On large tables, this often leads to **sequential scans**

Even if **no NULLs exist in the table**, the planner still has to check.

---

## üß® Real-World Example: Query Timeout

This issue occurred on database table with **over 100 million rows**.  
A query that should have completed instantly began taking several seconds ‚Äî and eventually **failed** with:

```
ActiveRecord::QueryCanceled
```

This happened because the database exceeded the `statement_timeout` due to the inefficient plan triggered by the presence of `nil` in the `id` list.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Practice

Always sanitize your arrays before using them in `.where(id: ...)`:

``` ruby
User.where(id: ids.compact)
```

Or validate explicitly:

``` ruby
raise ArgumentError, "ID list contains nil!" if ids.any?(&:nil?)
```
