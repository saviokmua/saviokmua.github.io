Sometimes you need to restrict access to specific areas of your websiteâ€”such as an admin panel, 
staging environment, or internal documentation. One of the simplest ways to do this is by enabling 
**Basic Authentication** using **Nginx**. In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to set up password protection in just a few steps.


## ðŸ”§ Nginx Configuration Example with Basic Auth
```config
server {
    server_name site.com;
    location / {
        ...
	      auth_basic           "Administrator Area";
        auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/protections/site.com.htpasswd;
        ...
    }
}
```

- `auth_basic` sets the authentication prompt message (realm).

- `auth_basic_user_file` specifies the path to the password file.


## ðŸ›  Installing Utilities & Creating a Password File

First, install the tool that allows you to create .htpasswd files:
```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```
Now create a new password file and add the admin user:
```bash
htpasswd -c site.com.htpasswd admin
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-c` flag creates a new file, overwriting it if it exists. Don't use `-c` when adding additional users.

Move the file to your desired location, such as:
```bash
sudo mv site.com.htpasswd /etc/nginx/protections/
```
<br>
Make sure to test your Nginx configuration and reload it:

```bash
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

## âœ… Best Practices for Security

- Store the .htpasswd file outside the publicly accessible directories.

- For more robust authentication, consider using OAuth, JWT, or integration with a centralized identity provider.

- Donâ€™t forget to enforce HTTPS to protect credentials during transmission.
